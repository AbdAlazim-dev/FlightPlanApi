Sure! Here is the markdown version of the project description:

## Project Name: NoSQL Database Experimentation in ASP .NET Core

### Description

This project was created to explore the implementation of a NoSQL database in an ASP .NET Core application. The main focus was on utilizing a MongoDB server, which was set up using MongoDb Compass. The MongoDb Driver NuGet package was used to access and manipulate the resources in the database.

### Key Learnings

During the development of this project, I gained the following key learnings:

- How to connect to a NoSQL server, specifically MongoDB, using MongoDb Compass.
- How to install and utilize the MongoDb Driver NuGet package in an ASP .NET Core application.
- Accessing and retrieving data from the MongoDB database using the driver package.
- Manipulating and updating resources within the MongoDB database using the driver package.

### Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following:

- ASP .NET Core SDK (version 6.0.X or later) installed on your machine.
- MongoDB server installed and configured using MongoDb Compass.
- MongoDb Driver NuGet package (version 2.23.1 or later) added to your ASP .NET Core project.

### Setup Instructions

To set up and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Make sure you have the required software and packages installed as mentioned in the Requirements section.
4. Update the connection string in your ASP .NET Core application to connect to your MongoDB server.
5. Build and run the application.
6. Test the functionality of accessing and manipulating resources in the MongoDB database.

### Additional Notes

- Please note that authentication and documentation were considered out of scope for this project. Therefore, the implementation of authentication, such as Basic Auth, and documentation generation with Swagger, was not included in this project.
- The main goal of this project is to learn how to use NoSql database in ASP .NET project so the UI is not the best i have create it using HTML and Bootstrap and Vanilla javascript 

Happy experimenting with MongoDb databases in ASP .NET Core!
